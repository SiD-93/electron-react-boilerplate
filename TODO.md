# Evaluate:

- [x] React Router
- [ ] A separate router file?
- [ ] A testing framework (Jest, Mocha, Chai, etc.)

## Research:

- [ ] Packaging apps (`electron-builder` or `electron-packager`).
- [ ] Different types of `histories` in React Router.
- [ ] Compare the performance of just this boilerplate vs. that in this [post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/building-an-electron-application-with-create-react-app-97945861647c#.jwxlm9a2v)

Note: This boilerplate is almost irrelavant now. `electron-prebuilt-compile` now has support for JSX and ES6 out of the box.
